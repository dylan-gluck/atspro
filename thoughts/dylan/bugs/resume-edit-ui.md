# Resume Edit: UI Changes

## Up/down buttons on main sections

There are buttons in the accordion header of each section that indicate the user can reorder the sections, these should not be here. Sections can not be re-ordered at this time.

For any array type field (Work experience, skills, responsibilities, etc) the user should be able to re-order the entries either through drag-and-drop or using the up/down icons.
