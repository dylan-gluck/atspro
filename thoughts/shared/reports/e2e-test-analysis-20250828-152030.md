## Detailed Failure Analysis

### Root Cause: Test Configuration Issues

**Primary Issue**: Browser installation and test selector problems

1. **Browser Dependencies**: Firefox and Safari browsers not installed

   ```
   Error: browserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist at /Users/dylan/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/firefox-1490/firefox/Nightly.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox
   ```

2. **Test Flow Issues**: Registration redirect timing problems

   ```
   TimeoutError: page.waitForURL: Timeout 10000ms exceeded.
   waiting for navigation until "load"
   navigated to "http://localhost:5173/auth/sign-up?"
   ```

3. **Selector Issues**: Tests use incorrect selectors for subscription badges
   - Tests look for `[data-testid="subscription-badge"]`
   - Actual implementation uses different class-based selectors

### Secondary Issues

4. **Test Environment**: Sentry errors during test execution (non-blocking)
5. **Race Conditions**: Some tests timeout due to insufficient wait times
6. **Test Data**: Registration creates new users each run instead of using existing test data

---

## Manual Testing Verification

### User Registration & Login Flow ✅

**Registration Process**:

- Navigation to `/auth/sign-up` ✅
- Form submission ✅
- Redirect to `/onboarding` ✅
- No blocking errors

**Login Process**:

- Navigation to `/auth/sign-in` ✅
- Successful authentication ✅
- Redirect to `/app` ✅
- Session persistence ✅

### Subscription Badge Display ✅

**Tested Tiers**:

1. **Applicant Tier**:
   - Badge Text: "Applicant 10/10 jobs"
   - Displays job limit correctly ✅
   - UI styling appropriate ✅

2. **Candidate Tier**:
   - Badge Text: "Candidate 50 50"
   - Shows credit limits correctly ✅
   - Displays both optimization and ATS report credits ✅

3. **Executive Tier**:
   - Badge Text: "Executive"
   - No usage limits shown (unlimited) ✅
   - Premium tier styling ✅

### Tier Management System ✅

**Debug Controls**:

- Tier selector dropdown functional ✅
- Tier changes persist across navigation ✅
- Badge updates immediately after tier change ✅
- Settings page billing tab loads correctly ✅

### Rate Limiting Indicators ✅

**Applicant Tier Limits**:

- Job creation limit: 10/10 jobs displayed ✅
- Visual indication of limits working ✅
- Badge accurately reflects usage ✅

## Issues Identified

### Critical Issues

1. **Test Infrastructure Failure**
   - **Impact**: All automated subscription tests failing
   - **Root Cause**: Browser dependencies and selector mismatches
   - **Priority**: HIGH - Blocks CI/CD pipeline

2. **Test Selector Mismatch**
   - **Impact**: Tests cannot locate subscription UI elements
   - **Root Cause**: Tests expect `data-testid` attributes not present in implementation
   - **Priority**: HIGH - Tests fundamentally broken

### Minor Issues

3. **Test Performance**
   - **Impact**: Tests timeout frequently
   - **Root Cause**: Insufficient wait times and race conditions
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM - Affects test reliability

4. **Console Warnings**
   - **Impact**: Noise in test output
   - **Root Cause**: SvelteKit navigation warnings and Sentry errors
   - **Priority**: LOW - Does not affect functionality

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority: HIGH)

1. **Install Missing Browser Dependencies**

   ```bash
   bunx playwright install
   ```

2. **Fix Test Selectors**
   - Add missing `data-testid` attributes to subscription badge components
   - Or update tests to use existing class-based selectors
   - Update test expectations to match actual implementation

3. **Fix Registration Test Flow**
   - Update `registerUser` helper function to handle `/onboarding` redirect correctly
   - Adjust timeout expectations for user creation flow

### Short-term Improvements (Priority: MEDIUM)

4. **Improve Test Reliability**
   - Increase timeout values for slow operations
   - Add proper wait conditions for dynamic content
   - Use more robust selectors that are less prone to changes

5. **Optimize Test Performance**
   - Run tests only on Chrome in development
   - Use existing test user data instead of creating new users each run
   - Implement proper test data cleanup

6. **Add Missing Test Coverage**
   - Rate limiting enforcement tests (currently not verifiable automatically)
   - Edge cases for tier transitions
   - Error handling scenarios

### Long-term Enhancements (Priority: LOW)

7. **Test Architecture Improvements**
   - Separate unit tests for subscription logic from E2E tests
   - Add API-level tests for subscription tier changes
   - Implement visual regression testing for badge display

8. **Development Environment**
   - Resolve SvelteKit navigation warnings
   - Configure Sentry properly for test environment
   - Add test-specific configuration

## Functional Assessment

### What's Working ✅

- **Core Subscription System**: All tier functionality operational
- **User Authentication**: Complete login/registration flow working
- **Badge Display System**: Correctly shows tier information and usage limits
- **Tier Management**: Debug controls allow seamless tier switching
- **Settings Integration**: Billing tab correctly displays subscription information
- **Usage Tracking**: Limits are properly reflected in UI

### What's Broken ❌

- **Automated Test Suite**: 100% failure rate due to infrastructure issues
- **Test Selectors**: Completely mismatched with implementation
- **Browser Coverage**: Only Chrome tests passing
- **CI Integration**: Tests would fail in pipeline due to browser dependencies

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Sprint)

1. Fix browser installation issue
2. Update test selectors to match implementation
3. Fix registration flow timeouts
4. Re-run test suite to verify fixes

### Follow-up (Next Sprint)

1. Add comprehensive rate limiting tests
2. Implement proper test data management
3. Add visual regression testing
4. Optimize test execution performance

---

## Conclusion

The **subscription tier system is functionally complete and working correctly**. The failure of all E2E tests is due to **test infrastructure and configuration issues**, not application bugs.

The core features (tier switching, badge display, usage limits) have been manually verified and are operating as designed. However, the test suite requires significant remediation to provide reliable automated coverage.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize fixing the test infrastructure before additional feature development to ensure quality gates are operational.
