**About the Team**

The Sora team is building large-scale ML capabilities from the ground up. We work at the intersection of research and infrastructure, designing and deploying the systems and algorithms that power high-impact, cross-functional initiatives. Our work bridges research ideas and production-grade systems in close collaboration with infrastructure, applied ML, and product teams.

**About the Role**

As a Senior Research Engineer, you will design, implement, and optimize large-scale ML systems. You’ll work across the stack—from algorithm design and model implementation to distributed systems and deployment—to bring state-of-the-art techniques into production. We’re looking for hands-on builders who thrive in early-stage, fast-paced environments, can navigate ambiguity, and are excited to create zero-to-one systems. This is not a purely research role—you’ll spend significant time writing and shipping high-quality code.

This role is based in **San Francisco, CA.** We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

**In this role, you will:**

-   Design, implement, and evaluate large-scale ML pipelines and core system components.

-   Build and integrate infrastructure to support model training, experimentation, and deployment.

-   Collaborate with research scientists to translate algorithmic ideas into robust, performant systems.

-   Own projects end-to-end—from prototype to large-scale production—balancing iteration speed with reliability


**You might thrive in this role if you:**

-   Have taken ML systems from concept to production at scale.

-   Have strong software engineering fundamentals (distributed systems, data storage, performance optimization) alongside applied ML skills.

-   Are comfortable working across boundaries of research, engineering, and infrastructure.

-   Enjoy both deep technical problem-solving and the scrappy execution required in a zero-to-one environment.
