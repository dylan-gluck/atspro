# Bun SQL vs node-postgres (pg) Analysis

## Current Setup

- **Package**: `pg` v8.16.3
- **Usage**: Direct Pool connection in `src/lib/db/index.ts` and `src/lib/auth.ts`
- **Better-Auth**: Requires a pg-compatible Pool object

## Bun SQL Capabilities (Tested)

### ✅ Working Features

1. **Basic Queries**: Template literal syntax works perfectly

   ```ts
   const result = await db`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;
   ```

2. **Parameterized Queries**: Native parameter interpolation

   ```ts
   const user = await db`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`;
   ```

3. **Connection Management**: Simple connection creation and closing

   ```ts
   const db = new SQL(DATABASE_URL);
   db.close();
   ```

4. **Result Format**: Returns arrays with metadata (count, command)

### ⚠️ Limitations Found

1. **No Connection Pooling**: Bun SQL doesn't expose connection pool management
2. **Transaction Syntax**: Different from pg (uses `sql.begin` instead of `BEGIN/COMMIT`)
3. **No Pool Interface**: Can't drop-in replace `new Pool()` for Better-Auth
4. **Limited Methods**: Fewer utility methods compared to pg

## Migration Analysis

### src/lib/db/index.ts Migration Effort: **HIGH**

```typescript
// Current (pg)
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: DATABASE_URL });
const { rows } = await pool.query(`SELECT * FROM "userResume" WHERE "userId" = $1`, [userId]);

// Bun SQL (would need refactoring)
const db = new SQL(DATABASE_URL);
const rows = await db`SELECT * FROM "userResume" WHERE "userId" = ${userId}`;
// Note: Different result structure, no .rows property
```

**Issues**:

- All 15+ database functions would need refactoring
- Different parameterization syntax ($1 vs template literals)
- Different result structure (array vs {rows: []})
- No connection pooling for concurrent requests

### src/lib/auth.ts Migration Effort: **BLOCKED**

```typescript
// Current (Better-Auth expects pg Pool)
export const auth = betterAuth({
	database: new Pool({ connectionString: DATABASE_URL })
	// ...
});

// Bun SQL - NOT COMPATIBLE
// Better-Auth specifically requires a pg-compatible Pool object
// Bun SQL doesn't provide this interface
```

**Critical Issue**: Better-Auth is not compatible with Bun SQL

## Performance Comparison

### Bun SQL Advantages

- **Native C++ bindings**: Potentially faster for simple queries
- **Zero dependencies**: Smaller bundle, faster startup
- **Built into runtime**: No separate driver needed

### pg Advantages

- **Connection pooling**: Essential for production scalability
- **Battle-tested**: Used in millions of production apps
- **Ecosystem compatibility**: Works with ORMs, Better-Auth, etc.
- **Advanced features**: Prepared statements, transactions, cursors

## Recommendation: **KEEP pg**

### Reasons to Stay with pg:

1. **Better-Auth Incompatibility**: This is a deal-breaker. Better-Auth requires pg's Pool interface, and migrating away from Better-Auth would be a massive undertaking.

2. **Connection Pooling**: Critical for production. Bun SQL lacks connection pooling, which would hurt performance under load.

3. **Migration Cost**: Would require rewriting all database functions with different syntax and result handling.

4. **Ecosystem**: pg has better ecosystem support, documentation, and community.

5. **Stability**: pg is battle-tested in production environments.

### When Bun SQL Makes Sense:

- New projects without existing dependencies
- Simple applications without auth libraries
- Scripts and CLI tools
- Projects that don't need connection pooling

## Alternative Optimization

Instead of switching to Bun SQL, consider these optimizations:

1. **Keep pg for now**: It's working well and is production-ready
2. **Monitor Bun SQL development**: It's still evolving and may add pooling/compatibility later
3. **Use Bun's runtime benefits**: You still get Bun's faster startup, better performance
4. **Consider pg connection tuning**: Optimize pool settings for your workload

## Conclusion

While Bun SQL shows promise with its native performance and zero-dependency approach, it's not mature enough to replace pg in this project. The lack of Better-Auth compatibility alone makes migration impossible without a complete auth system rewrite.

**Verdict: Stay with pg for this project.**
