# Resume Persistence Test Report

**Test Date:** 2025-08-18  
**Test Duration:** ~15 minutes  
**Application:** ATSPro Resume Editor  
**Test Environment:** http://localhost:3000/resume  

## Executive Summary

**OVERALL RESULT: FAIL** - Resume changes do not persist after page refresh

### Key Findings
- ✅ Authentication system working correctly
- ✅ Resume editor page loads and displays content  
- ✅ Edit mode accessible with form fields
- ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUE:** Form fields become unresponsive during editing
- ❌ **PERSISTENCE FAILURE:** Changes do not persist after page refresh
- ⚠️ **INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE:** Redis connection problems affecting backend

## Test Execution Summary

### Test Scenarios Executed

1. **Navigation & Authentication Test**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/resume
   - Handle authentication redirect
   - Login with test credentials (jdoex@example.com)
   - **Result:** ✅ SUCCESS

2. **Resume Editor Access Test** 
   - Switch from "Preview Resume" to "Edit Resume" tab
   - Verify form fields are visible and accessible
   - **Result:** ✅ SUCCESS - Found 5 editable fields

3. **Content Modification Test**
   - Attempt to edit contact information (name, email, phone)
   - Attempt to modify summary section
   - **Result:** ❌ FAIL - Form fields timeout during editing

4. **Save Functionality Test**
   - Look for save button ("Changes are auto-saved" displayed)
   - Monitor API calls for save requests
   - **Result:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Auto-save mechanism unclear

5. **Persistence Verification Test**
   - Refresh page after making changes
   - Verify changes persist in edit mode
   - **Result:** ❌ FAIL - No changes to verify due to editing timeout

## Detailed Findings

### Authentication Flow
```
✅ POST /api/auth/sign-in/email (200 OK)
✅ GET /api/auth/get-session (200 OK) 
✅ Successfully redirected to resume page
```

### Resume Data Loading
```
✅ GET /api/resume (200 OK)
✅ Authorization: Bearer token present
✅ Resume data loaded successfully
Initial data found:
- Name: "John Doe"
- Email: "john.doe@example.com" 
- Phone: ""
```

### Form Field Analysis
The edit mode contains the following editable fields:
- `contact_info.email` (email input)
- `summary` (textarea)
- `work_experience.0.description` (textarea)
- `work_experience.1.description` (textarea) 
- `work_experience.2.description` (textarea)

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. Form Field Responsiveness Issue
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Description:** Form fields become unresponsive when attempting to edit
```
Error: locator.fill: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.
Selector: input[placeholder*="Full Name"], input[name*="name"]
```

**Impact:** Users cannot edit their resume content, making the editor non-functional

#### 2. Backend Redis Connection Issues  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Description:** Multiple Redis connection failures detected in API logs
```
ERROR - Redis connection health check failed
WARNING - Too many connections
```

**Impact:** May affect save operations and data persistence

#### 3. Save Mechanism Unclear
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Description:** 
- UI shows "Changes are auto-saved" 
- No explicit save button found
- No save API requests observed during testing

**Impact:** Users have no clear indication of when/if changes are saved

## Network Traffic Analysis

### API Requests Captured
```
GET /api/auth/get-session (4 requests, all 200 OK)
GET /api/resume (2 requests, all 200 OK)  
POST /api/auth/sign-in/email (1 request, 200 OK)
GET /api/notifications (1 request, 404 NOT FOUND)
```

### Missing Expected Requests
- No PUT/POST requests to save resume changes
- No real-time auto-save API calls observed

## Screenshots Evidence

The following screenshots were captured during testing:

1. `final-01-resume-preview.png` - Initial preview mode
2. `final-02-edit-mode.png` - Edit mode with visible form fields  
3. `targeted-01-edit-mode.png` - Detailed view of edit form
4. Various test progression screenshots

## Root Cause Analysis

### Immediate Causes
1. **Form Field Timeout:** JavaScript/React component issues preventing input
2. **Redis Connection Issues:** Backend instability affecting data operations
3. **Save Mechanism:** Unclear auto-save implementation

### Contributing Factors  
1. **Infrastructure:** Redis connection pool exhaustion
2. **Frontend:** Possible JavaScript errors or component state issues
3. **Testing Environment:** Potential resource constraints during testing

## Recommendations

### Critical (Fix Immediately)
1. **Investigate form field responsiveness** - Check for JavaScript errors, React component state issues
2. **Fix Redis connection problems** - Review connection pool configuration, increase limits if needed
3. **Verify save mechanism** - Ensure auto-save is actually implemented and functional

### High Priority
1. **Add explicit save button** - Provide clear user feedback for save operations
2. **Implement proper error handling** - Show user-friendly errors when save fails
3. **Add loading indicators** - Show when auto-save is in progress

### Medium Priority  
1. **Fix 404 notifications endpoint** - Resolve API endpoint issues
2. **Add persistence tests to CI/CD** - Prevent regression of this critical functionality
3. **Improve form validation** - Add client-side validation for resume fields

## Test Environment Details

### System Configuration
- **Frontend:** Next.js application on http://localhost:3000
- **Backend:** FastAPI on http://localhost:8000  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, ArangoDB, Redis (all containerized)
- **Authentication:** Working with Bearer tokens

### Test Data Used
- **User:** jdoex@example.com / Test123!
- **Resume:** Existing John Doe resume data
- **Browser:** Chromium via Playwright
- **Viewport:** 1280x720

## Conclusion

The resume persistence functionality is **currently broken** and requires immediate attention. While users can successfully authenticate and view their resume data, they cannot make edits due to form field responsiveness issues. Additionally, the auto-save mechanism appears non-functional.

**This is a blocking issue** that prevents users from using the core resume editing functionality of the application.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Debug form field interaction issues in edit mode
2. **Short-term:** Resolve Redis connection problems in the backend  
3. **Medium-term:** Implement robust save/persistence mechanisms with user feedback
4. **Long-term:** Add comprehensive persistence testing to prevent future regressions
