# Test Failure Report: PDF Upload Issue in Onboarding Flow

**Date**: 2025-08-16
**Test Environment**: Docker containers (API, Web, PostgreSQL, Redis, ArangoDB)
**Bug Status**: REPRODUCED and ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

## Summary

Successfully reproduced the PDF upload failure in the onboarding flow. The issue is not specific to PDF files but affects all file uploads. The problem occurs during task status polling after successful file upload initiation.

## Test Execution Details

### Test Data Used
- **User**: jdoex@example.com / Test123! (existing account)
- **File**: .test-data/resume.pdf (2.8MB PDF file)
- **Additional Test**: resume.txt (80 bytes text file)

### Reproduction Steps
1. Navigated to http://localhost:3000
2. Signed in with test credentials
3. Reached onboarding flow (Upload Your Resume section)
4. Attempted to upload .test-data/resume.pdf
5. Observed upload progress stall at 15%
6. Error message displayed: "Failed to get task status"

## Technical Analysis

### Network Request Flow
1. **POST /api/parse** - ✅ SUCCESS (200 OK)
   - Task created with ID: `3e053f55-6836-418d-98af-1eaf877a8345`
   - Response time: 7ms

2. **GET /api/tasks/3e053f55-6836-418d-98af-1eaf877a8345** - ❌ FAILED (404 Not Found)
   - Response time: 5ms
   - **ROOT CAUSE**: Task ID not found when polling for status

### API Logs Analysis

#### Task Creation (Successful)
```
INFO: POST /api/parse HTTP/1.1 200 OK
INFO: Worker ResumeParseWorker_60fdb58b received task 3e053f55-6836-418d-98af-1eaf877a8345
INFO: Task 3e053f55-6836-418d-98af-1eaf877a8345 assigned to worker ResumeParseWorker_60fdb58b
```

#### Task Processing (Failed)
```
ERROR: Unstructured parsing failed for task 3e053f55-6836-418d-98af-1eaf877a8345: 
Unable to get page count. Is poppler installed and in PATH?

ERROR: Task 3e053f55-6836-418d-98af-1eaf877a8345 permanently failed after 1 attempts: 
Failed to extract text from document: Unable to get page count. Is poppler installed and in PATH?
```

#### Task Status Query (404)
```
INFO: GET /api/tasks/3e053f55-6836-418d-98af-1eaf877a8345 HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Missing Poppler Dependency
The API container is missing the **poppler** utility required for PDF text extraction:
- Error: "Unable to get page count. Is poppler installed and in PATH?"
- Task fails permanently after 1 attempt
- Failed task is not stored in retrievable state

### Secondary Issue: Task Status Management
1. Task is created and assigned to worker ✅
2. Task processing fails due to missing dependency ❌
3. Failed task is not accessible via GET /api/tasks/{task_id} ❌
4. Frontend polling receives 404 instead of failure status ❌

### File Type Impact
- **PDF files**: Fail due to poppler dependency missing
- **TXT files**: Also fail with same "Failed to get task status" error
- Issue affects ALL file uploads, not just PDFs

## Screenshots Captured

1. **homepage.png** - Initial sign-in page
2. **after_signin.png** - Onboarding flow loaded
3. **file_upload_initiated.png** - PDF upload showing 15% progress and error
4. **onboarding_fresh.png** - Fresh onboarding page for TXT test
5. **txt_upload_test.png** - TXT file showing same error pattern

## Environment Details

### Container Status
- ✅ atspro-api (running)
- ✅ atspro-web (running) 
- ✅ atspro-postgres (running)
- ✅ atspro-redis (running)
- ✅ atspro-arangodb (running)

### API Health Check
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "atspro-api", 
  "workers": {
    "status": "running",
    "total": 2,
    "running": 2,
    "active_tasks": 2
  }
}
```

## Recommended Fixes

### Immediate (Critical)
1. **Install poppler in API container**
   - Add poppler-utils to Dockerfile
   - Rebuild and deploy API container

2. **Fix task status endpoint**
   - Ensure failed tasks are accessible via GET /api/tasks/{task_id}
   - Return proper error status instead of 404
   - Frontend should handle failed task status appropriately

### Medium Priority
3. **Improve error handling**
   - Better error messages for missing dependencies
   - Graceful degradation for unsupported file types
   - Retry mechanism for transient failures

4. **Add dependency validation**
   - Health check should verify required utilities (poppler, etc.)
   - Startup validation of worker dependencies

## Test Validation

- ✅ Bug successfully reproduced
- ✅ Error message confirmed: "Failed to get task status"
- ✅ Upload stalls at 15% as reported
- ✅ Network requests captured and analyzed
- ✅ API logs show exact failure point
- ✅ Issue affects multiple file types
- ✅ Root cause identified: missing poppler + task status API issue

## Impact Assessment

**Severity**: HIGH - Completely blocks user onboarding flow
**Users Affected**: All new users attempting to upload resumes
**Workaround**: None available
**Business Impact**: Prevents new user registration and platform adoption

---

**Next Steps**: Development team should prioritize fixing the poppler dependency and task status endpoint to resolve the complete onboarding flow blocker.
