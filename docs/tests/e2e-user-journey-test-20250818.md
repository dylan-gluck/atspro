### High Priority 
1. **Implement Job Parsing**: Extend backend worker to handle job URL parsing
2. **Add Error Handling**: Better user feedback when operations fail
3. **Resume Auto-save**: Fix auto-save functionality for better UX

### Medium Priority
1. **Mobile Job Management**: Consider making job features accessible on mobile
2. **Validation Enhancements**: Add client-side validation for better UX
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics collection for save operations

### Low Priority
1. **Visual Polish**: Minor UI enhancements
2. **Additional Tests**: Expand test coverage for edge cases
3. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance review

## Test Coverage Summary

| Feature Area | Coverage | Pass Rate |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Authentication | 100% | 100% |
| Navigation | 100% | 100% |
| Settings Management | 100% | 100% |
| Resume Editing | 100% | 20% |
| Job Management | 80% | 25% |
| Responsive Design | 100% | 100% |
| **Overall** | **96%** | **74%** |

## Conclusion

The application demonstrates excellent foundation with outstanding settings management and responsive design. However, **critical resume persistence issues** require immediate attention as this is a core user workflow. Job parsing functionality needs implementation to complete the feature set.

The test reveals that while recent resume persistence fixes may have addressed some backend issues, there are still problems in the complete user workflow that need investigation.

**Priority**: Address resume persistence immediately, then implement job parsing functionality.
