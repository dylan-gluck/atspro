# Test Failure Report: Resume Data Issue

**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Test Type**: End-to-End Onboarding Flow  
**Priority**: HIGH - Core user flow broken  
**Status**: CRITICAL FAILURE ❌

## Executive Summary

**Issue**: Users successfully complete onboarding with resume upload, but cannot access their resume data in the editor due to a backend API error.

**Root Cause**: Missing `created_at` field in resume data structure causing 500 errors in `/api/resume` endpoint.

## API Error Analysis

### Backend Logs Analysis
From `atspro-api` container logs:

```
2025-08-17 22:00:22,845 - INFO - Stored resume b45f879d-6a01-43f2-99d4-3651f16a899b for user 7Pc1Sm63oPyTn1rYcWg20wVObccKGsGd
2025-08-17 22:00:22,847 - INFO - Updated user profile for user 7Pc1Sm63oPyTn1rYcWg20wVObccKGsGd with resume b45f879d-6a01-43f2-99d4-3651f16a899b
2025-08-17 22:00:22,848 - INFO - Resume parsing completed for task 21178fdc-ddbd-4dd4-8ee6-a6bd2bd6e344
```

**Resume storage completed successfully** ✅

```
INFO: 172.66.0.243:52221 - "GET /api/resume HTTP/1.1" 500 Internal Server Error
2025-08-17 22:00:41,526 - ERROR - Error retrieving current user's resume: 'created_at'
```

**Resume retrieval fails consistently** ❌

### Error Pattern
- **HTTP Status**: 500 Internal Server Error
- **Error Message**: "Error retrieving current user's resume: 'created_at'"
- **Frequency**: Every attempt to access `/api/resume`

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Identified
The resume data is successfully stored in the database during onboarding, but when the `/api/resume` endpoint tries to retrieve it, there's a **missing `created_at` field** causing a KeyError.

### Probable Causes
1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: Resume records created without `created_at` timestamp
2. **Serialization Issue**: Resume model expects `created_at` field that wasn't saved
3. **Migration Issue**: Missing column in database schema
4. **Code Bug**: Resume creation doesn't set `created_at` but retrieval expects it

### Data Flow Analysis
1. ✅ Resume uploaded via `/api/parse`
2. ✅ Task created and processed by worker
3. ✅ Resume stored in ArangoDB with ID `b45f879d-6a01-43f2-99d4-3651f16a899b`
4. ✅ User profile updated with resume reference
5. ❌ Resume retrieval fails due to missing field

## Technical Investigation Required

### Database Layer
- [ ] Check ArangoDB resume collection schema
- [ ] Verify resume document structure for user `7Pc1Sm63oPyTn1rYcWg20wVObccKGsGd`
- [ ] Confirm `created_at` field presence in stored documents

### API Layer  
- [ ] Review `/api/resume` endpoint implementation
- [ ] Check resume model/schema definitions
- [ ] Verify serialization logic for resume responses
- [ ] Test direct database queries vs API responses

### Frontend Layer
- [ ] Verify error handling for 500 responses
- [ ] Check if frontend falls back gracefully
- [ ] Test resume editor with mock data

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Database Investigation
```bash
# Connect to ArangoDB and check resume document
docker-compose exec arangodb arangosh
# Query: FOR r IN resumes FILTER r.user_id == "7Pc1Sm63oPyTn1rYcWg20wVObccKGsGd" RETURN r
```

### 2. API Code Review
```bash
# Check resume endpoint implementation
cd apps/api
grep -r "created_at" app/
grep -r "resume" app/routers/
```

### 3. Schema Validation
- Compare resume creation vs retrieval code paths
- Identify where `created_at` should be set
- Verify Pydantic models match database schema

## Test Screenshots

1. **Homepage Login**: Successfully authenticated
2. **Dashboard Active Resume**: Shows "Active" status despite retrieval failure
3. **Onboarding Success**: File upload and processing completed
4. **Resume Editor Failure**: "Unable to load resume" error state

## Impact Assessment

### User Experience
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Core functionality completely broken
- **User Flow**: Onboarding → Success → Editor → Complete failure
- **Workaround**: None available
- **Data Loss**: No data lost, retrieval issue only

### Business Impact
- New users cannot edit resumes after onboarding
- False positive dashboard status misleads users
- Complete breakdown of primary application value proposition

## Recommended Fix Priority

1. **URGENT**: Fix missing `created_at` field in resume storage/retrieval
2. **HIGH**: Add proper error handling in frontend for 500 responses  
3. **MEDIUM**: Improve dashboard status accuracy based on actual resume accessibility
4. **LOW**: Add better user messaging for edge cases

## Test Environment Details

- **Docker Containers**: All running (api, web, postgres, redis, arangodb)
- **Network**: All services accessible
- **Performance**: Normal response times except for failing endpoint
- **Data**: Test user and resume data created successfully
