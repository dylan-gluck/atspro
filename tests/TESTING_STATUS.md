# Testing Status - ATSPro

## Current Test Infrastructure ✅

### Working Tests

- ✅ Basic unit test framework (Vitest)
- ✅ Mock database tests (pg module mocking)
- ✅ Simple utility tests
- ✅ E2E test framework (Playwright configured)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)

### Test Execution

```bash
$ bun run test
 ✓ src/demo.spec.ts (1 test)
 ✓ src/lib/utils/__tests__/simple.test.ts (5 tests)
 ✓ src/lib/db/__tests__/database-mocks.test.ts (15 tests)

 Test Files  3 passed (3)
      Tests  21 passed (21)
```

### Available Commands

- `bun run test` - Run unit tests ✅
- `bun run test:coverage` - Run with coverage ✅
- `bun run test:watch` - Watch mode ✅
- `bun run test:e2e` - Run E2E tests (requires dev server)
- `bun run test:summary` - Show coverage summary ✅

## Limitations & Notes

### SvelteKit Components

- Component tests require SvelteKit runtime
- Remote functions (`query`, `command`, `form`) need app context
- Testing these requires either:
  - Running E2E tests against dev server
  - Extracting business logic for unit testing

### Coverage

- Coverage reporting enabled but thresholds disabled
- Low coverage expected in early development
- Focus on critical path testing

### E2E Tests

- Playwright installed with Chromium
- Tests configured but require running dev server
- Run with: `bun run dev` then `bun run test:e2e`

## Next Steps for Full Testing

1. **Business Logic Tests**
   - Extract logic from remote functions
   - Create testable service layer
   - Unit test core algorithms

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Set up test database
   - Test actual database operations
   - Test authentication flows

3. **E2E Coverage**
   - Implement critical user journeys
   - Test form submissions
   - Verify data persistence

## Summary

✅ **Test infrastructure is functional**

- All configured tests pass
- Mock testing works properly
- E2E framework ready to use
- CI/CD pipeline configured

The testing setup provides a solid foundation for development. Tests can be added incrementally as features are built.
