# Development Planning

Create a comprehensive development plan for: $ARGUMENTS

## Planning Process

As the orchestrator, I will coordinate the planning process:

1. **Analyze Requirements**
   - Launch doc-expert research documentation and gather context
   - Launch fullstack-eng to analyze technical feasibility
   - Launch code-review to assess current code quality

2. **Create Implementation Plan**
   - Break down requirements into manageable tasks
   - Identify dependencies and potential blockers
   - Estimate complexity and development effort

3. **Document Plan**
   - Store comprehensive plan in memory using mcp__memory__store
   - Create TODO list for progress tracking
   - Generate workflow definition if applicable

## Expected Output

- Detailed task breakdown with priorities
- Technical specifications and dependencies
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Timeline and milestone estimates

I will coordinate multiple agents in parallel to gather all necessary information for comprehensive planning.
